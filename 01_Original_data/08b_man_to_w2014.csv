"2014 Medicare Advantage, and Cost Plans",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data as of June 1, 2014.  Includes 2014 approved contracts/plans.  PACE, Special Needs Plans, Part B Only Plans, and Employer  sponsored plans (800 series) are excluded. Plans under sanction are not shown.  Medicare/Medicaid plans are shown in a separate Landscape file.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Notes: Data are subject to change as contracts are finalized.  For 2014, enhanced alternative plans may offer additional gap coverage which is calculated as the percentage of “generic” formulary products with coverage above and beyond the 2014 standard ""generic"" coverage gap cost-sharing benefit and/or the percentage of “brand” formulary products covered in addition to the coverage gap discount for applicable drugs.  Additional gap coverage levels are determined separately for formulary generic and brand products and are described as follows:   “All”: 100% of formulary drugs are covered through the gap, “Many”: ?65% to <100% of formulary drugs are covered through the gap, “Some”: ?10% to <65 % of formulary drugs are covered through the gap, “Few”: >0% to <10% of formulary drugs are covered through the gap (and must also be >15 ""brand"" products covered through the gap), “No Gap Coverage”:  0% of formulary drugs are covered through the gap (or ?15 ""brand"" products covered through the gap).  A label of “All Formulary Drugs” is applied for plans that cover 100% of “generic” and 100% of “brand” products (either by covering all formulary drug products in the gap or by having no initial coverage limit).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
